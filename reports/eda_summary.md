# EDA Summary: Music Mood Classifier

## Dataset Overview

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Rows | 114,000 |
| Columns | 20 |
| Target column | `track_genre` |
| Unique classes | 114 |
| Missing values | 3 |

## Target Variable Discovery

The column `track_genre` was selected as the target because:

- The column name contains the keyword **genre**, which directly signals
  a classification target in a music dataset.
- The dtype is `object`, consistent with categorical labels.
- Cardinality is 114 unique values, well within the range expected
  for a music genre classification task.
- Every class contains at least 1000 samples.

## Class Balance Assessment

The dataset is **perfectly balanced** (all classes have the same number of samples).

- Minimum samples per class: 1,000
- Maximum samples per class: 1,000

Because the dataset is balanced, no resampling (SMOTE or class weighting) was required.

## Feature Importance (Mutual Information with Target)

Mutual information quantifies the dependency between each feature and the target.
Higher values indicate stronger association.

## Key Observations

1. The dataset has 114 genre classes, each with exactly 1,000 samples, making it
   perfectly balanced. No resampling is needed.
2. The text columns (track_id, artists, album_name, track_name) are dropped before
   modelling as they are identifiers, not audio features.
3. `instrumentalness` and `speechiness` are heavily right-skewed, indicating most
   tracks are neither instrumental nor speech-heavy.
4. `acousticness` shows high variance and skew, reflecting the diversity of genres.
5. `popularity` ranges from 0 to 100 with a mean around 33, suggesting many obscure
   or niche tracks in the dataset.
6. `energy` and `loudness` are positively correlated, as expected for music.
7. `valence` (musical positiveness) is roughly uniformly distributed, covering
   both sad and happy sounding music.
