## Reports

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `eda_summary.md` | Full exploratory data analysis: class distribution, missing values, feature statistics, mutual information ranking, and key observations. |
| `model_selection.md` | Cross-validation comparison table for all candidate models, selection rationale, GridSearchCV tuning results, and the best hyperparameters found. |
| `evaluation_report.md` | Final test-set evaluation: accuracy, weighted and macro F1, per-class classification report, and links to figure files. |
| `improvement_log.md` | Only present if test accuracy fell below 80%. Documents each improvement attempt, what was tried, and the outcome. |
